  In the electricity-carbon blockchain trading system, with the rapid expansion of blockchain technology applications, intrusion events targeting blockchain nodes are becoming increasingly frequent, and security issues are becoming more prominent. The security situation of blockchain systems is increasingly complex and severe. To meet the requirements for real-time and accurate anomaly detection in the electricity-carbon blockchain trading system, this paper proposes an active-passive-combined anomaly detection method. This method comprises two parts: passive anomaly detection and active anomaly detection. Passive anomaly detection collects and analyzes blockchain nodes' network traffic and triggers active anomaly detection when passive anomaly detection identifies an anomaly. In contrast, active anomaly detection collects and evaluates log data from suspicious nodes. This framework can process and analyze large-scale network alerts and host logs under limited bandwidth. Experimental results on real blockchain nodes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
